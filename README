  Homematic CCU ReGaHSS Watchdog
  Written by Oliver Wagner <owagner@vapor.com>

  How this works:

  We monitor whether the system variable WATCHDOG was modified within the last
  3 minutes. If not, we kill the last generated ReGaHSS forked process.

  If we can't determine the variable timestamp after 60 minutes,
  or if there is no ReGaHSS instance, we reboot.

  Additionally, we're using the system watchdog /dev/watchdog.
